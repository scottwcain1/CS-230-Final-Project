# CS-230-Final-Project

Overview
This repository holds my complete software design document created for The Gaming Room. It shows my ability to effectively work through the design of a software application and communicate it clearly to clients and development team members. The Gaming Room client is a development team planning to release an online picture-guessing game called "Draw It or Lose It." The software can communicate between various platforms, manage user information, and handle single-game instances with multiple teams and players.

The Gaming Room client needed a cross-platform game application, "Draw It or Lose It," which supports multiple operating systems. The software required features for storing users and their information, managing multiple game instances, and allowing online communication between different platforms. I was able to present recommendations and information based on the user's needs. I made a strong case for my recommendations and supplied information on why I reached those conclusions.   Categorizing different aspects of the project helped organize thoughts and research. By compartmentalizing elements like client-side experience and server capabilities, it was easier to summarize the benefits and drawbacks of different strategies. This organization also made it easier to follow thought processes, as recommendations could reference earlier findings in the document.

If I had to do anything it would be my research and findings for the macOS system. I missed some updates to the system and feel I didn’t research enough about macOS systems. This extra time focused on the macOS system could have given me more details and facts but in the end, it does not meet the user's need for “Draw it or Lose it”.
I interpreted the user's needs as requiring cross-platform capabilities, leading me to research APIs. Understanding and prioritizing their needs lets me focus on what key functionalities need to be met, preventing delays and meeting their expectations.
Setting a clear goal made it easier to break down the project into smaller parts, there in how each piece fits together to achieve the original objective. In the future, I would research similar software to understand better the project's final look and gain strategies for my projects.
